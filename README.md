## How to Distill Alcohol Cleanly

Distilling alcohol involves several steps to ensure a clean and safe end product. Here's a beginner's guide:

### 1. Fermentation

Fermentation is the initial step in alcohol production. Follow these basics:

1. **Introduce Sugar**: Mix sugar with liquid (such as fruit juice or grain mash).
2. **Add Yeast**: Yeast will process the sugar into alcohol over time⁶.

### 2. Distillation Process

1. **Set Up Your Still**: Make sure your distillation equipment is clean and properly assembled.
2. **Heat the Mixture**: Apply heat to the fermented liquid. Alcohol vaporizes at a lower temperature than water.
3. **Collect the Vapor**: The alcohol vapor rises through the still and condenses into liquid form.
4. **Separate the Heads, Hearts, and Tails**:
   - **Heads**: Initial distillate with impurities (discard).
   - **Hearts**: The desired alcohol (collect).
   - **Tails**: End distillate with more impurities (discard).
5. **Repeat the Process**: Run the liquid through the still multiple times for higher purity.

### 3. Safety Tips

- **Clean Equipment**: Regularly clean your distillation apparatus to prevent contamination.
- **Avoid Methanol**: Discard the initial distillate (heads) to avoid methanol, which is toxic.
- **Monitor Temperature**: Maintain proper temperature during distillation.

Remember to follow local regulations and safety guidelines when distilling alcohol at home.

## About

This project aims to foster collaboration between Balinese Arak distillers and Cambodians, to enhance the quality of homemade whiskey. Balinese Arak is an iconic traditional alcoholic drink produced in Bali, Indonesia. It has been around for centuries and is considered a great souvenir for tourists visiting the island. Locals often drink Arak for various purposes, including medicinal and religious ceremonies¹.

Cambodian Whiskey could reach a fascinated export market, if the quality reached higher standards. Because of their ancient friendship, the Balinese could help improve Khmer whiskey, even remotely, via WhatsApp, Facebook and Github.

## Goals

- **Knowledge Exchange**: Balinese Arak distillers will share their expertise with Cambodian whiskey makers via Social media.
- **Quality Improvement**: By leveraging traditional methods and techniques, Cambodians can enhance the flavor and safety of their homemade whiskey.
- **Cultural Exchange**: This collaboration celebrates the rich heritage of both regions and promotes cross-cultural understanding.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from anyone interested in improving whiskey production. Whether you're a distiller, enthusiast, or researcher, feel free to come to our issues page, FB and WhatsApp Groups!
